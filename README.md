### Subject : Semantic-Segmentation-with-High--and-Low-level-Consistency
### Host : Concordia University
### Supervisors : Prof. Nizar BOUGUILA and M. Vahid KHORASANI GHASSAB 

## Description

- In this project, we have implemented semi-supervised semantic segmentation using an adversarial net-work with semi-supervised classification. When training with few labels, the dual-branch technique eliminates both low-level and high-level errors.
